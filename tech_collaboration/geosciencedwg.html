				<h1>Geoscience Domain Working Group</h1>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/geosciencedwg" target="_blank">Geoscience Domain Working Group</a> 
(DWG) is a working group of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) that is co-chaired by OGC and CGI. It aims to connect people to develop, improve and promote 
technologies for geoscience data description and sharing.</p>
<p>The DWG will: </p>
<ul><li>develop communications materials that focus on the technical problem area of geoscience data management and exchange</li>
<li>engage members of the geospatial data community (including relevant OGC working groups) and the geoscience community</li>
<li>conceive, design, coordinate and implement projects that demonstrate technical approaches to geoscience data management and exchange within the context of the 
OGC suite of technologies and other relevant emerging technologies</li>
<li>as appropriate, serve as a forum for the development of specification profiles and application schemas for geoscience purposes</li></ul>
<p>The DWG maintains an <a href="https://portal.opengeospatial.org/?m=projects&a=view&project_id=539" target="_blank">OGC mailing list</a> (requires an OGC login) and is currently chaired by Micka&euml;l Beaufils from BRGM. Read <a href="https://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/pub/GeoScienceDWG/WebHome/OGC_GeoScience_Standards_AGU2018.pdf" target="_blank">

<h2>Borehole Interoperability Experiment</h2>

<p>The Geoscience DWG is currently undertaking a <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/boreholeie" target="_blank">Borehole Interoperability Experiment</a>. 
This activity aims to clarify the commonalities between several existing 
data standards for describing a borehole, its associated data and their position along a borehole, including some OGC and CGI standards such as GroundwaterML and 
GeoSciML. These approaches are largely restricted to a specific borehole viewpoint (e.g. groundwater, petroleum, engineering). The IE aims to provide a semantic 
umbrella linked to the pre-existing work by distilling the core elements shared by all disciplines. </p>
