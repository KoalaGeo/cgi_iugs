				<p>In order to further the objectives of the CGI various technical collaboration activities are being supported. Some of these are being carried out by formal <a href="workingGroups.html">Working Groups</a> of the CGI whereas others are less formal activities for which the CGI is providing a forum on this website. Current technical collaboration activities are listed below, along with a link to the activity's web pages. In most cases the web pages of the technical groups are publicly available as it is an objective of the CGI to encourage the widest possible level of involvement in its activities.</p>
