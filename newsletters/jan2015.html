					<div id="PeterBaumann">
						<div class="imgBoxRight30"><img src="/images/council/peterBaumann.jpg" alt="Dr Peter Baumann" /></div>
						<p> <strong>Dr Peter Baumann</strong>, Professor of Computer Science at Jacobs University and a current CGI council member,  was awarded the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/awards/gardels" target="_blank">Kenneth D. Gardels Award by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)</a> for 2014. The award is in recognition of his "significant contribution to the OGC's essential role and mission in the global Information Technology community".</p>
						<p> Jeffrey K. Harris, Chairman of the OGC Board of Directors, said: "We wish to express our deep appreciation for the extraordinary contribution you have made to the OGC community and to people around the world who are the ultimate beneficiaries of improvements in the development, management and use of geoscientific data. Devoting your time and bringing your dedication, expertise, critical thinking and leadership to OGC working groups has resulted in significant and enduring advances in technical standards. The value you've createdhas been leveraged, and the OGC's work overall has been leveraged, through your active participation in other standards bodies, expert groups, councils and commissions. We thank you for this collaborative work, for it benefits us all."</p>
						<p> Peter is editor of twelve adopted standards related to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) suite of Big Geo Data standards. Recently he has been instrumental in establishing a new Big Data Domain Working Group within the OGC which he also co-chairs. Peter's research focuses on large-scale scientific information services, in particular: massive multi-dimensional data cubes. He has architected the <a href="http://www.rasdaman.com/" target="_blank">rasdaman</a> ("raster data manager") technology which has pioneered a new research field, Array Databases.</p>

					<div id="IanJackson">
						<div class="imgBoxRight30"><img src="/images/newsletters/ianJackson.jpg" alt="Ian Jackson" /></div>
						<p> The Geological Society of America honoured <strong>Ian Jackson</strong> with their <a href="http://www.geosociety.org/awards/14speeches/geoinfo.htm" target="_blank">Outstanding Contributions in Geoinformatics award</a> for 2014. The award recognises an individual who has contributed in an outstanding manner to geology through the application of the principles of geoinformatics.</p>
						<p> Ian was a councillor of CGI from 2004 to 2012. Ian understood the importance of standards to achieve the opening of geoscientific data for diverse uses, and took a decisive part in the recreation of the IUGS-CGI.</p>
						<p> The award citation notes Ian's long and superb service to advance the field of geoinformatics through his pioneering work at the British Geological Survey, to the establishment and unprecedented success of the OneGeology initiative. A dominant theme throughout Ian's career has been the wide application of geoscience data for societal benefit, a goal he continues to promote as a consultant on the international stage. Ian has been one of the first in geological survey organizations worldwide to understand, and more importantly, to change the organization of the survey to fulfill its role of "information agency."</p>
						<p> Among his many accomplishments, Ian is perhaps best known as the primary instigator of OneGeology - a global initiative to make digital geological map data accessible throughout the world. Ian's colleagues uniformly refer to his ability to inspire others on the OneGeology concept and build a strong team with the skills to create OneGeology, his keen awareness of how to get things done, and his ability to find constructive ways around obstacles as key to the success of the initiative.</p>

					<h2 id="newWGchair"> New Working Group Chair</h2>
					<div class="imgBoxRight40"><img src="/images/newsletters/markRattenbury.jpg" alt="Mark Rattenbury" /></div>
					<p> Mark Rattenbury from GNS-New Zealand is the new chair of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Mark took over from Steve Richard who handed over the reins after many years of inspirational leadership of CGI's vocabulary development team. Mark has extensive experience in geological mapping, particularly of complexly deformed and metamorphosed basement terranes of Australia, Antarctica, and New Zealand. He led the 1:250 000 scale Geological Map of New Zealand programme to its conclusion in 2010 and is a specialist in geological map data management and dissemination using GIS software and web services. Mark is also a participant in the OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group, as well as being the New Zealand representative on the OneGeology Technical Implementation Group.</p>
					<h2 id="vocabularies"> New Geoscience Vocabularies</h2>
					<div class="imgBoxRight40"><img src="/images/mine.jpg" alt="Mine" /></div>
					<p> The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) recently published 18 new geoscience vocabularies at the <a href="http://resource.geosciml.org/" target="_blank">CGI's vocabulary resources website</a>. The vocabularies describe features of mineral resources such as resource shape and form, exploration and mining activities, and resource and reserve classifications. The GTWG worked in collaboration with the EarthResourceML Working Group to compile the new vocabularies to support the EarthResourceML data transfer standard, most importantly as the standard for mineral resource data transfer for the EU INSPIRE initiative.</p>
