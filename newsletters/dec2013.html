					<h2 id="linkedIn">Join us on LinkedIn</h2>
					<div class="imgBoxRight10"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6539642" target="_blank"><img src="/images/linkedin.jpg" alt="LinkedIn logo" /></a></div>
					<p> We invite all CGI members to join our new <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6539642" target="_blank">LinkedIn group</a>.  The group provides a forum for CGI and LinkedIn members to connect with other geoscience professionals, post news of upcoming events, ask questions and discuss your issues.</p>
					<h2 id="workingGroups" class="clear"> CGI Working Groups &mdash; old and new</h2>
					<p> At the recent CGI Council meeting in November in Denver, USA, the long-running Interoperability Working Group (IWG) headed by John Laxton from the British Geological Survey, was dissolved.  However, that does not mean the work of John and the IWG members is over.</p>
					<p> The IWG's <a href="http://www.geosciml.org/" target="_blank">GeoSciML</a> Task Group became a Standards Working Group of the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/" target="_blank">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> in January 2013, chaired by <a href="mailto:oliver.raymond@ga.gov.au">Ollie Raymond</a> of Geoscience Australia.  Future development and documentation of GeoSciML will be done under a collaborative arrangement between OGC and CGI.</p>
					<p> Development of the EarthResourceML data transfer standard for mines and mineral occurrences will be continued by a new CGI <a href="https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/CGIModel/EarthResourceML" target="_blank">EarthResourceML Working Group</a>, headed by <a href="mailto:jouni.vuollo@gtk.fi">Jouni Vuollo</a> of the Finnish Geological Survey.</p>
					<h2 id="GTWG" class="clear"> Geoscience Terminology Working Group</h2>
					<p> The CGI's Geoscience Terminology Working Group is looking for new members to help the global effort to publish multilingual vocabularies to support delivery of standards-based geoscience data.</p>
					<p> If you would like to contribute to the working group, contact the group's chair, <a href="mailto:steve.richard@azgs.az.gov">Steve Richard</a>.  Read more about <a href="/tech_collaboration/geoscience_terminology_working_group.html">the working group</a>.</p>
					<h2 id="EarthResourceML" class="clear"> EarthResourceML version 2 released</h2>
					<div class="imgBoxRight50"><img src="/images/newsletters/ernesthenry_big.jpg" alt="Mining photo" /></div>
					<p> Version 2.0 of the CGI data standard for mineral occurrences and mines has been published. <a href="http://schemas.earthresourceml.org/2.0/" target="_blank">XML schemas</a> and <a href="http://www.earthresourceml.org/earthresourceml/2.0/" target="_blank">documentation</a> are available from the EarthResourceML (ERML) website.  A simple features version of the ERML standard - ERML-Portrayal - is also soon to be published by the CGI <a href="https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/CGIModel/EarthResourceML" target="_blank">ERML Working Group</a>.  ERML is now fully compatible with the requirements of the European Commission's <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2" target="_blank">INSPIRE data specification</a> for Mineral Resources.  Geological Surveys in <a href="http://www.geoscience.gov.au/" target="_blank">Australia and New Zealand</a> have also endorsed the ERML standard for delivery of mineral occurrence data.</p>
					<h2 id="GeoSciML-Portrayal" class="clear">GeoSciML-Portrayal version 2 released</h2>
					<div class="imgBoxRight30"><a href="http://www.geosciml.org/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/GeoSciML.jpg" alt="GeoSciML logo" /></a></div>
					<p>Version 2 of the GeoSciML-Portrayal simple features WFS data standard was released in August.  The <a href="http://schemas.geosciml.org/geosciml-portrayal/2.0/" target="_blank">schema</a> provides a simple attribute structure for digital map portrayal of geologic units, faults, contacts, and now borehole collar locations.  GeoSciML-Portrayal is also recommended for use as an attribute standard for WMS web services.  The data standard is endorsed by several international data sharing initiatives, including <a href="http://www.onegeology.org/" target="_blank">OneGeology</a> and the <a href="http://usgin.org/" target="_blank">US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN)</a>. Find out <a href="http://www.geosciml.org/#geosciml-portrayal" target="_blank">more information on GeoSciML-Portrayal</a>.</p>
					<h2 id="geosciml_cookbook" class="clear"> GeoSciML v3.2 "cookbook" published</h2>
					<p> A new instructional <a href="http://www.geosciml.org/geosciml/3.2/documentation/cookbook/INSPIRE_GeoSciML_Cookbook%20_1.0.pdf" target="_blank">cookbook for GeoSciML web services</a> has been published by CGI and the European Union's INSPIRE Directive.  Although the cookbook has been written mostly to address INSPIRE use cases, all users of the GeoSciML data standard will find it a useful guide.</p>
					<h2 id="onegeology" class="clear"> New Managing Director for OneGeology</h2>
					<div class="imgBoxRight40"><img src="/images/newsletters/marko_komac.jpg" alt="Marko Komac" /></div>
					<p> Marko Komac, Director of the Geological Survey of Slovenia, vice-president of IUGS, and CGI member, has been appointed as the new Managing Director of OneGeology.</p>
					<p> The OneGeology initiative is a major partner of CGI in promoting interoperability and delivering geological map data using CGI and OGC data standards.  Find out <a href="http://www.onegeology.org/" target="_blank">more information about OneGeology</a>.</p>

					<p> The <a href="http://www.giraf-network.org/GIRAF2009/EN/GIRAF2013-Workshop/giraf2013-workshop_node.html" target="_blank">3rd GIRAF Workshop</a> took place in Accra, Ghana, from 22nd to 27th of September, coinciding with the centennial celebrations of the Geological Survey of Ghana.  121 participants from 26 African and 7 non-African countries took part.  The Geoscience InfoRmation in Africa network (GIRAF) was founded in 2009 and currently has 337 Members from 37 African and 15 non-African countries.  GIRAF is governed by the CGI and is supported by the UNESCO.</p>
					<p> The GIRAF-network brings together African scientists, authorities, national experts and other stakeholders in geoscience.  GIRAF provides a platform to address, discuss and raise awareness of what geoscience information can do to - in the long-term - improve the way geoscience information contributes to the health and prosperity of the people in Africa. </p>
