              <h4>2&ndash;8 March, 2020, Delhi, India</h4>
              <p>Abstracts are invited to the special symposium <a href="https://www.36igc.org/science-program" target="_blank">Advances in geoscience data sharing and processing</a> (Theme 45.10) at the 36th International Geological Congress (IGC). The symposium will highlight new techniques, standards, and algorithms for managing, delivering, visualising and analysing geoscience data both globally and regionally, including 'big' data. The symposium is jointly organised by CGI, IAMG, and OneGeology.</p>

              <p>CGI sponsors an award to assist early career scientists to present at conferences such as the IGC on the use of CGI standards in data delivery and analysis. The award covers up to US$2000 towards the cost of travel and accommodation at the IGC in Delhi. Registration cost is covered by the Young Earth Scientists (YES) Network. <a href="/docs/CGI_YES_award_2019-20.pdf">Full details</a>.</p>
              <p>Applications for the 36th IGC award close on 15 October 2019. </p>

              <p><A href="http://earthresourceml.org/" target="_blank">EarthResourceML-Lite</A> is a data model and schema for simple map services (e.g. WMS and WFS Simple Features). It is an abridged version of the full EarthResourceML model and can be used to deliver simplified views on mineral occurrences and their commodities, mines, mining activities and mine waste products.</p>

              <p>The CGI Council and two of its standards working groups &mdash; Geoscience Terminology and EarthResourceML &mdash; convened in May in Madrid in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.geology.cz/gic" target="_blank">34th Geoscience Information Consortium</a> (GIC) conference at the Spanish Geological Survey, IGME.  Progress was made towards publishing several new geoscience vocabularies. Progress was also made towards publication of a new version of EarthResourceML (version 3.0), to address some issues identified by current users of the EarthResourceML v2.0 data transfer standard. </p>
